This is a rewrite of the DTD parser from the JOX library. It should parse
most DTD's fine. It only understands comments, <!ELEMENT, <!ATTLIST,
<!ENTITY, <!NOTATION, <![ INCLUDE/IGNORE and anything between <? ?>,
although comments and <? ?> items are ignored.

If there are other items that belong in a DTD, I'll try to include them
in here.

To use the parser, just create a DTDParser object with a Reader that is
reading the DTD (i.e. if you need to read a DTD from a URL, you need to
create the URLConnection yourself and slap a Reader around it).

The Tokenize.java program reads a DTD and spits out a lot of the
information returned if you need to see how to navigate through the
DTD object.
